# write a method called "transpose" that takes this array of arrays:

[
['first', 'second'],
['third', 'fourth']
]

[
['first', 'third'],
['second', 'fourth']
]

# you can think of it as rows become columns
# I know there is an Array method called "transpose" but
# I am asking you to write your own
